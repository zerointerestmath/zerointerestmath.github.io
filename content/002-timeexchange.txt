Interest: An Exchange Rate Across Time
The "real rate" is arbitrary.

What many people don't seem to realize, is
that the choice of a "real interest rate", is arbitrary.

When we provide interest, we are exchanging money across
time, or better stated, temporarily upgrading between
money forms.


okay so what are we actually talking about here? 
zero interest rates are not the optimal policy
why not?
volatility

Interest does not change potential valuation,
that is a balance sheet and "cash" flow matter,
but interest can do a few things:
 - increase real borrowing by offering competitive returns
 - 







Supply of fiat creates its own demand

more fiat issuance corresponds with more
economic activity performed. if an asset goes to zero,
that reduces total value in the world.


Fiat and other large assets set the benchmark

The simplest reason why assets like fiat currencies and national
debts aren't competing directly with smaller assets, can be
thought of in terms of understanding that these assets are so
large, that they disproportionately affect average returns.

However, affecting the average is not the full picture,
and this becomes clear once you look at total value 
and total valuations, and not just returns or change in value.

There are only so many assets to be owned in the world,
and if an asset goes down in value, that simply decreases
the total value that exists in the world. Strictly speaking,
money is not "put in" or "taken out" of assets, except
when those assets are exchanged with the original issuer.
Assets trade at relative prices.

There is no universal rule to assess whether a price
decline is part of longer trend a potential "acceleration"
or if the market is constrained and the asset is now
a "bargain buy".
