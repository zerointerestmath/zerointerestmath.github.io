Why r &lt; 0 is okay.
Productivity gains are more important than financial gains

Financial returns do not need to be positive for the economy to keep growing,
nor to make private investments worthwhile.

How you might ask?

Well there are two reasons really.  First of all, if people are able
to earn more through wages, then they will be able to save more.

For the typical worker this might go something like this:

<ol>
  <li>
    At what point would you rather have higher financial returns
    but lower wages?
  </li>
  <li>
    At what point would you rather have lower financial returns
    but higher wages?
  </li>
  <li>
    At what point would total wealth be maximized in the tradeoff
    between financial returns and wages.
  </li>
</ol>

Considering that the vast majority of americans live paycheck
to paycheck, boosting wages would be a higher priority on
their totem pole.

What many financial people and economists neglect to recognize
is that wealth can grow in one of two ways: earning new assets
through new work, or having existing assets appreciate.  Well,
it is much more effective to have the majority of economic 
growth come from earning new assets through new work, than
the financial appreciation of existing assets.  The problem
is, these financial people and economists, live in an unusual
world, where the balance is tipped heavily toward financial
returns.

Even with negative financial returns on all assets, total
financial wealth can increase by issuing more assets: equity
shares, currencies, government debt.

The goal of the economy as a whole should be a large amount
of sustainable wealth, and I think that one could argue that
this is achieved with financial returns, <i>r</i>, are close
to zero or slightly negative, and the majority of wealth is
earned through work output.

For someone already wealthy, the amount they can earn through
wages and working for income is likely small 

<h3> A tale of two r's </h3>

Let us consider two different r's.

<table> 
  <th> r<sub>public</sub> <th> <td> The inflation adjusted return on government bonds </td>
  <th> r<sub>private</sub> <th> <td> The inflation adjusted average return on private financial assets. </td>
</table>

Even if r<sub>private</sub> &lt; 0, then people may still choose to
invest privately.  Here are some potential reasons.

<ol>
  <li>
    The potential upside may be worth the risk, or people prefer
    being involved in private enterprise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial management can minimize and reduce losses.
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial investment can change the economy to offer the things you want.
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial investments can improve productivity and have other synergies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial losses may be acceptable if tax climate is more ammenable to wealthy.
  </li>
</ol>

If r<sub>private</sub> &lt; 0, why would anyone bother investing privately in the first place?
First of all, we should be clear, that government spending is just
a democratically administered investment.  So it's not like there
would be no investment.  Instead the investment merely becomes
concentrated in areas that are public and increase shared wealth.

When the public benefits, private balance sheet health improves as well.
This may not be reflected as nominal gains.  Imagine that we developed
a technology where people could perform photosynthesis in their skin
and didn't have to eat as long as they got some time in the sun every
day.  Eliminating the need to eat gets rid of a massive liability on
everyone's balance sheet, so it would make our balance sheets much
better, even if there was no nominal increase in our assets.  Likely,
the asset side of people's balance sheets would decrease, because they
would choose not to work as much&emdash; as there would be little need.


Now, for the reasons to invest privately, even if average returns are
less than zero.  First of all, some people may simply prefer to be
involved in private financial ventures, even if the odds are against
there success.  Countless people do this every day with things
like sports, competitive gaming, and more.  Even if the chance of 
succeeding at 

There are all kinds of benefits to being in charge of your own
enterprise or business, that may make private investments attractive
even without probable financial returns.  What private industry affords
you is control and self direction.  So if you want to do a project you can.
My expectation is not that a lack of financial opportunity would lead to
r &lt; 0, but rather the extreme ease with which one could earn a decent amount
of money through wages and working for income.  If people can easily earn
income through work, then they will increasingly engage in enterprises without
probabilistically positive returns.

This brings us to the second reason to invest in private enterprise, even
if it does not offer financial returns.  Let's say you have a very passionate
hobby, say rock climbing or hang gliding.  Let's say you are pretty well off,
and spend tens of thousands of dollars a year on expensive gear.  You spend
this much money, and all your buddies do too.  Now, if y'all pool together
and start a business making gear, even if each of your investments lose
money, if that means you can buy your gear for less money, then you may come out
ahead.  Furthermore, investing in your own enterprise, will let you choose
what kind of gear you make, which may not have been available previously at any
price.

There are all sorts of hobbies that have exploded with recent technology trends:
rc aircraft and drones, personal electric transit like one-wheels.  Even more
traditional hobbies like mountain biking and road cycling have seen incredible
improvements. If someone can earn good wages through work, and then invest
to see the products <i> they want </i> developed, they may be willing to
do so without financial returns, or for smaller financial returns.
