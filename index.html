<h3>Productivity gains are more important than financial gains</h3>
<p>
Financial returns do not need to be positive for the economy to keep growing,
nor to make private investments worthwhile.</p><p>How you might ask?</p><p>Well there are two reasons really.  First of all, if people are able
to earn more through wages, then they will be able to save more.</p><p>For the typical worker this might go something like this:</p><p><ol>
  <li>
    At what point would you rather have higher financial returns
    but lower wages?
  </li>
  <li>
    At what point would you rather have lower financial returns
    but higher wages?
  </li>
  <li>
    At what point would total wealth be maximized in the tradeoff
    between financial returns and wages.
  </li>
</ol></p><p>Considering that the vast majority of americans live paycheck
to paycheck, boosting wages would be a higher priority on
their totem pole.</p><p>What many financial people and economists neglect to recognize
is that wealth can grow in one of two ways: earning new assets
through new work, or having existing assets appreciate.  Well,
it is much more effective to have the majority of economic 
growth come from earning new assets through new work, than
the financial appreciation of existing assets.  The problem
is, these financial people and economists, live in an unusual
world, where the balance is tipped heavily toward financial
returns.</p><p>Even with negative financial returns on all assets, total
financial wealth can increase by issuing more assets: equity
shares, currencies, government debt.</p><p>The goal of the economy as a whole should be a large amount
of sustainable wealth, and I think that one could argue that
this is achieved with financial returns, <i>r</i>, are close
to zero or slightly negative, and the majority of wealth is
earned through work output.</p><p>For someone already wealthy, the amount they can earn through
wages and working for income is likely small </p><p><h3> A tale of two r's </h3></p><p>Let us consider two different r's.</p><p><table> 
  <tr><th> r<sub>public</sub> <th> <td> The inflation adjusted return on government bonds </td></tr>
  <tr><th> r<sub>private</sub> <th> <td> The inflation adjusted average return on private financial assets. </td></tr>
</table></p><p>Even if r<sub>private</sub> &lt; 0, then people may still choose to
invest privately.  Here are some potential reasons.</p><p><ol>
  <li>
    The potential upside may be worth the risk, or people prefer
    being involved in private enterprise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial management can minimize and reduce losses.
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial investment can change the economy to offer the things you want.
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial investments can improve productivity and have other synergies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial losses may be acceptable if tax climate is more ammenable to wealthy.
  </li>
</ol></p><p>If r<sub>private</sub> &lt; 0, why would anyone bother investing privately in the first place?
First of all, we should be clear, that government spending is just
a democratically administered investment.  So it's not like there
would be no investment.  Instead the investment merely becomes
concentrated in areas that are public and increase shared wealth.</p><p>When the public benefits, private balance sheet health improves as well.
This may not be reflected as nominal gains.  Imagine that we developed
a technology where people could perform photosynthesis in their skin
and didn't have to eat as long as they got some time in the sun every
day.  Eliminating the need to eat gets rid of a massive liability on
everyone's balance sheet, so it would make our balance sheets much
better, even if there was no nominal increase in our assets.  Likely,
the asset side of people's balance sheets would decrease, because they
would choose not to work as much&emdash; as there would be little need.</p><p>
Now, for the reasons to invest privately, even if average returns are
less than zero.  First of all, some people may simply prefer to be
involved in private financial ventures, even if the odds are against
there success.  Countless people do this every day with things
like sports, competitive gaming, and more.  Even if the chance of 
succeeding at </p><p>There are all kinds of benefits to being in charge of your own
enterprise or business, that may make private investments attractive
even without probable financial returns.  What private industry affords
you is control and self direction.  So if you want to do a project you can.
My expectation is not that a lack of financial opportunity would lead to
r &lt; 0, but rather the extreme ease with which one could earn a decent amount
of money through wages and working for income.  If people can easily earn
income through work, then they will increasingly engage in enterprises without
probabilistically positive returns.</p><p>This brings us to the second reason to invest in private enterprise, even
if it does not offer financial returns.  Let's say you have a very passionate
hobby, say rock climbing or hang gliding.  Let's say you are pretty well off,
and spend tens of thousands of dollars a year on expensive gear.  You spend
this much money, and all your buddies do too.  Now, if y'all pool together
and start a business making gear, even if each of your investments lose
money, if that means you can buy your gear for less money, then you may come out
ahead.  Furthermore, investing in your own enterprise, will let you choose
what kind of gear you make, which may not have been available previously at any
price.</p><p>There are all sorts of hobbies that have exploded with recent technology trends:
rc aircraft and drones, personal electric transit like one-wheels.  Even more
traditional hobbies like mountain biking and road cycling have seen incredible
improvements. If someone can earn good wages through work, and then invest
to see the products <i> they want </i> developed, they may be willing to
do so without financial returns, or for smaller financial returns.

<h2 id='004-moneyisabstraction.txt'>Money is an Abstraction, Math is the study of quantitative abstractions</h2>
<h3>The historical importance of money is its technology</h3>
<p>
A lot of people like to say "money isn't real", or "money is just
something we made up".  Whether or not these statements are true,
they miss the point of money.  Money is a tool, with real world
effects.  It is not imaginary, but does require engagement of
the imagination.  Money is an abstraction, and abstractions
are very real, and very powerful.</p><p>The problem with studying money mathematically, is that
money is a quantitative abstraction, but it is not just
a quantitative abstraction, it is essentially qualitative
as well.</p><p>It would be nice to be able to make a computer to tell
us how money works, or to predict what happens with money,
but that is precisely the problem.  Accounting is the 
computer and money is the data this computer uses. You can never
perfectly emulate money, because it is always, by definition,
the best computer we have for tracking resources.</p><p>And so when we study money and the economy, this is what
we must respect.  Trying to model money, is like
trying to simulate a physicist working on a math problem.</p><p>We may be able to say "oh, they walked to the chalk board,
they wrote symbols, the electrons fired in their brain"
and so forth.  But the physicist is the one solving the
problem already.  Any attempt to model the physicist instead
of trying to model physics, is just a futile layer of abstraction.</p><p>What money and prices do, is try to model value, or rather, 
the saving of human labor.  See the value of money and 
exchange, is not the labor required as input, but rather
the labor which an output saves the recipient.
Incidentally, it may
be helpful to realize that money 
is the exact opposite of sex and exercise.
 Sex and exercise are things where you can't pay someone 
to do the work for you.</p><p>
So how does money relate to math?</p><p>Math is the study of quantitative abstractions, meaning
numbers.  And while in advanced math, what is a number
becomes much more loose and open minded, these "unusual
numbers" (ie rings, groups, categories, etc)
still follow strict rules and relate to each other in
specific ways.</p><p>So if money is a quantitative abstration, and math is the 
study of quantiative abstrations, then what's the issue?</p><p>Well, the issue is this, money is not <i>just</i> a 
quantitative abstraction.  It is qualitative as well.</p><p>This is why different forms of money are always in
competition or tension with each other, always deciding
which one is more real, always discovering what is 
actually the best tool for the job.  And this brings
us to the issue of interest rates.</p><p>Why interest only makes sense in private, commercial
relationships.</p><p>Interest is an inducement to hold an inferior form
of money.  If you pay interest on a form of money
which is not inferior, it is not an inducement, only
a reallocation at best, or redenomination at worst.</p><p>For it to be reallocation, someone must be on the
losing end.  And specifically, the amount lost
must compare directly to the amount someone else
gains.  Otherwise, it is only partially reallocation.</p><p>Public money is necessarily the highest form of money,
and that is because it represents common consent and
collective interest.  It is possible for public money
to not exist, but if it exists, it is always on top.</p><p>What makes it public is not simply conceptual support,
but practical use.  Public interest is a non-localized,
binding constraint on any localized social endeavor.  It is
something sufficient to cause a reaction or outcry that
censors(or supports), those actions.  The constraint
is non-local, in that applies everywhere, but the
realization of this constraint is always local, ie
it is realized in a specific place.</p><p>The simplest example of a public interest is the
notion of property.  Violating property is so
offensive, that detected and permanent violations
get recorded in database with permanent effects. </p><p>So this is where people get property wrong. Property
is not simply a private interest in controlling
a resources or a exclusive right, rather it is a
public interest in securing private reservation.
Private property is recognized and defended not
simply by the owner themselves, but by the rest of
society who support laws, institutions, and processes
to protect this private interest.</p><p>So you cannot simultaneously deny public interests,
and believe in the notion of private property, because
private property is an example of a public interest.</p><p>In this case, again, it is not sufficient for us to
say "oh, we would like this", or "I support this interest",
what makes something a public interest is the practical
ability to enforce that, not simply a shared wish or
desire to see something happen.</p><p>And this is where the interest of interest comes in.
As interest is an inducement to hold an inferior form
of money, it means there is no existing public interest
to effect whatever end that monetary relation is meant 
to effect.  If you pay interest to finance a private
enterprise, that inherently means that it is not a public
interest.</p><p>All public interests are inherently self-financing, in
that defending that interest means lower costs, rather
than higher costs. This is how public interests get
established.  It is much cheaper for us to universally
recognize property, than to try to individually defend
property at all times.  If an interest inducement is
required for something to work, then it is not inherently
self sustaining in terms of costs, it requires
recompensatory profit.</p><p>And that is the nature and purpose of commerce, to distribute
the rewards of activities with private individual benefits.
If an activity has public benefits, then it only needs
to be organized, and not financed.  The tokens do not need
to be backed, but rather people willingly forfeit private
interests, in the form of tax, because a tax is always
cheaper than the alternative without public organization.</p><p>This is not to say that all taxes are equally effective,
only that in the net, a system of taxation(an imposition
of private costs), tends to have a net benefit over a system
without any public interests.  It is also possible for
a system to begin as a net benefit, but then degrade until
it is no longer net beneficial.  Like a supersaturated
crystal solution, sometimes there may be a seed or catalyst
required to induce reorganization.</p><p>So importantly, a tax, as part of a larger system of public
interest, is a net cost-saver.  If we lived in a society
where we could not call police against trespassers, then
in such a society, private property no longer exists. At
that point all we have is territory, which makes us no
different from animals, for better or worse. And that
brings us to this larger issue what makes us human?</p><p>Civility is the foundation of humanity.</p><p>Civility is the respect for person and property, and it
is what defines humanity.  Although we have other anthropological
peculiarities and morphological features, civility, the respect
for our peers, in terms of both person and property, is what
defines humanity.</p><p>This is not to say that we always behave civilly, or that
uncivil behaviors never present advantages.  Only that the
ability to self-censor our behaviors toward our peers, has
helped us be much more successful than short-sided selfishness.</p><p>While civility is something that developed between humans
respecting other humans, it is also something we have learned
to demonstrate for nature itself, although not in the exact same
manner or degree.  We need to eat other living things, plants
at the least, and in many cases still rely on eating other animals.</p><p>But despite that, we have fostered a respect for nature and the
preservation of ecosystems and animal life.  If anything, this
is a reflection of the tremendous impact we have on the rest
of life on earth.  If we did not exercise self-restraint and
self censorship, we could easily destroy all other living things
and ourselves in the process.  By any account this is undesireable.</p><p>
So if the foundations of society and public interest have
nothing to do with mathematics, how can we use mathematics?</p><p>Mathematics is very useful, if for nothing else, than the
analytical skills we develop and tools we can create.  Money
fundamentally is a computational technology, which we use
to compute and realize humanity's interests all at the
same time.  And we didn't get where we are today through
wanton abandon of any restraint or limitations.  We got
here by deliberately cultivating respect.  This is something
that is not just for the lower classes, but for all.</p><p>If we advertise for ourselves a life without compromises,
power with out restraint, profit without preservation,
we will only realize for ourselves self destruction.</p><p>And this is the power of public money and public interest.
It literally saves costs over the alternatives, that alternative
being planetary destruction.  Not to say every naive effort with
this goal in mind will be effective, only that a successful effort
will be worth it, if we can manage it.</p><p>Interest on public money is not part of the deal.</p><p></p>

<h2 id='003-problemwithdeflation.txt'>The Problem With Deflationary Currencies</h2>
<h3>You never know when they are in a bubble</h3>
<p>
I've been reading Matt Levine's <i> Money Stuff </i> newsletter,
and been really enjoying it.  I think it has a casual flowing
style, which makes it readable even for sometimes challenging
topics like finance.  So here's me trying to imitate that
style.</p><p>Bitcoin has been tremendously popular.  Technically, almost
anything can be popular: music, books, tv, colors.  The
popularity of bitcoin shows us one thing for sure, people
want financial alternatives.  They want to believe in a 
system besides one in which banks and governments dictate
what we do why and when.</p><p>There are a lot of problems with bitcoin. Being popular
with libertarians, not being very stable.  Losing your
money, someone else losing your money, etc.  Most of
these problems were known and understood from the outset.</p><p>I have a strong background in mathematics and computer science,
and even took a course in cryptography in my first stint at
university.  About the time that bitcoin came out, I was taking
courses in theory of computation and algorithms.  I started
to be obsessed with NP problems, I really wanted to find
a way to "cache" solutions to subproblems,
what is called "dynamic programming".</p><p>Little did I know, that about this same time, there was the early
stages of gold rush into another form mathematical problem solving,
very simple hash function inversions, without much computational
meaning.  My younger self would have been surprised to learn that
people were about to make a whole lot of money, without doing anything
particularly meaningful.</p><p>But most these problems were known from the outset.  What may
not have been anticipated, is that bitcoin would be wildly successful,
with countless copycats, and little place to go.</p><p>And this leads us to the inherent problem with deflationary currencies.
If a currency is inflationary, then you know the market cap, or amount
in circulation, is basically what people need.  It's very unlikely that
people are saving a ton extra, because that's a losing strategy.  So
you don't get a lot of giant idle stacks.  The reason why these giant
idle stacks are important, is that the bigger the stack, the more
potential fuel there is to feed into a crash.</p><p>And that's really the truth of all currencies, not just bitcoin,
even metal based currencies.  They are always ready to crash, but
the so called "deflationary" ones tend to have a lot further to fall.</p><p>So the irony is, with an inflationary currency, you know that demand for
it is organic.  People only save what they need to, because saving
extra is just not very smart.  So if it does begin to fall more rapidly,
well it may suck, but that was always part of the deal.  If you were
the one stacking an inflationary currency, then you were the sucker
to begin with.</p><p>In many ways national fiat debts have become the currency.  They have been
the worst performing yet most widely held asset for some time.  So they
do have a long way to fall.</p><p>Such falls can be arrested by suspending the conversion of a fiat
debt, back into the fiat currency, ie sovereign default.  Not that
that is the smartest way to deal with this.  But currencies always
did well when they were lean and mean.  Just enough in circulation
so that most people could access them, but not enough that anyone
would lose too much if they failed.</p><p>This particular post is not really about MMT, you can read that
100 other places and I'm sure I'll keep explaining all of that
both now and in the future.  What this post is about, is 
currency as a design problem, not solving the problem
of society->tax->money->credit->currency.</p><p>If you want to make a currency, you gotta have some form
of demand.  Initially bitcoin was like "oh this thing is
expensive to create, but anyone can create it".  This
is not a bad way to create a currency.  The problem
was that instead of inflation, for some odd reason the
currencies designers thought deflation is better for
a currency.  This goes against millenia of economic
lessons and acquired practice.  Maybe they were on
to something?</p><p>Well, I think it turns out, no, they weren't on
to anything.  The shame is that we could have a
thriving decentralized online token, which maybe
works for payments, and makes digital commerce
a whole lot more convenient.  Instead, by embracing
deflation instead of inflation, we got a ton of
hype, scams, ponzi schemes, rug pulls, crashes,
venture capital failures, etc.</p><p>Maybe we can reboot the thing, but I think if we
do, then proof of work is not the solution.  But
in either case, here we are, many of us with
bags in our hands, trying to sell them.</p><p>
