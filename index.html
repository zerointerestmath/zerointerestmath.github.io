<h3>How we choose prices affects how resources are allocated.</h3>
<p>
Price is a choice, nevertheless, the price system
must always be considered holistically, and in the
context of resource distribution.</p><p>So a system of prices always begins as a unitless system.

<h2 id='timeexchange.txt'>Interest: An Exchange Rate Across Time</h2>
<h3>The "real rate" is arbitrary.</h3>
<p>
What many people don't seem to realize, is
that the choice of a "real interest rate", is arbitrary.</p><p>When we provide interest, we are exchanging money across
time, or better stated, temporarily upgrading between
money forms.</p><p>
